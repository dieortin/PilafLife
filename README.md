# PilafLife
PilafLife is a web application for checking the menu in CMU Juan Luis Vives' 
dining hall.

It depends on an external API to retrieve the data, which is then parsed and 
presented to the user in a more friendly way.

## Technologies
PilafLife is built using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org)  2.0
with plain ES6 Javascript and HTML5. It uses some web components such
as [paper elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/collection/PolymerElements/paper-elements)
and follows Material Design guidelines.

Support for old browsers hasn't been a real concern during development, so 
PilafLife might not work as expected on those.
